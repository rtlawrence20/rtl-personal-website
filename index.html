                    With an APE degree in Chemical Engineering, I have had the opportunity to work with fascinating startup companies such as Vision Logistics and Radix.
                    At both places, I had the chance to solve accounting, logistics, and automation problems. Such professional experiences have not only deepened my knowledge 
                    but also enriched my appreciation for the creative and ever-changing realm of technology. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-text">
                    Before my transition into the world of engineering, I was a competitive speed skater for 15 years and won a gold medal at the Junior World Championships, 
                    was part of the USA Senior World Team, and participated in the 2010 and 2014 Olympic Trials. Although I did not make it to the Olympics, 
                    the experience gave me the discipline, focus, and grit that I still apply to every challenge I face. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-text">          
                    Along that path, I had the wonderful opportunity of exploring the world, plunging myself into different and peculiar cultures. 
                    Those visits had a lasting effect on me as they helped me broaden my horizon and be more open to different opinions and outlooks. 
                    This is something that has influenced both my personal and business life. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-text"> 
                    Personally, I am married to a great wife who is in the healthcare profession and we have just been blessed with a lovely little girl. 
                    Fatherhood has made me more committed to creating a better future with even more zeal for both my family and the world they will inherit.
